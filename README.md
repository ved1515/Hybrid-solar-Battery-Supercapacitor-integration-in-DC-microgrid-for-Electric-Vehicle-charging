The integration of renewable energy into the grid
is through Hybrid Energy Storage Systems has been on a rise
nowadays. The issues that arise from the integration are caused
by excessive power generation and unregulated power supply.
From the load side, problem arises due to unregulated energy
demand that reduces the quality of power in the network region.
The system needs to be regulated for grid stability in varying
load conditions and to increase the efficiency of power harnessed
from renewable energy. This study focuses on a hybrid system
that uses photovoltaic-powered energy stored in battery and
super capacitor are proposed to solve the problems in the load
and generation sides. A unique way of a load based hybrid
energy storage system is developed through 2 dc–dc converter.
A model which integrates power from an renewable energy
source(solar-PV arrays) , a battery and a SC is proposed and
implemented in Simulink software. The idea is that the varying
loads present a Challenge which can solved by this topology of
DC-DC converters.
